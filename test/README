Overview:
----------------

This directory contains various scripts that are used to test various l2dbus
features.  These scripts are also meant as example code for various operations.

Usage:
----------------

Go to the test directory in a terminal and source: ./setLuaEnv.sh
The "setLuaEnv.sh" will setup the Lua paths as well as check for various
dependencies needed to run the files in the test directory.


File Details:
----------------

/utils              This directory contains source used within some of the 
                    files in the "test" directory.

test_*.lua          These are various test scripts testing and showing how to
                    use various features.  

test_monitor.lua    Simple script that implements basic "dbus-monitor" output.
                    Can be easy and useful to create very specific filters.

reg_tests.lua       This is a script used to regression test much of the API and 
                    various other l2dbus features.  This is an ongoing work in 
                    progress.  As bugs are found they should be covered here.

ping_stress.lua     This is a ping program that implements both the server and 
                    client side of the test.  This can be used as an example
                    as well as test various feature and throughput.  Use:
                    lua ./ping_stress.lua -h for detailed help.

bluez.lua           This is an example showing how you can use l2dbus to 
                    communicate with a 3rd party component.  Some features 
                    still need work (see file header for specifics).
